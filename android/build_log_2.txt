WARNING: Unsupported Kotlin plugin version.
The `embedded-kotlin` and `kotlin-dsl` plugins rely on features of Kotlin `1.9.0` that might work differently than in the requested version `1.9.20`.

* What went wrong:
Could not determine the dependencies of null.
> Could not resolve all task dependencies for configuration 'classpath'.
   > Could not resolve project :gradle.
     Required by:
         unspecified:unspecified:unspecified
      > No matching variant of project :gradle was found. The consumer was configured to find a library for use during runtime, compatible with Java 8, packaged as a jar, and its dependencies declared externally, as well as attribute 'org.gradle.plugin.api-version' with value '8.3' but:
          - Variant 'apiElements' capability dev.flutter.plugin:gradle:1.0.0 declares a library, packaged as a jar, and its dependencies declared externally:
              - Incompatible because this component declares a component for use during compile-time, compatible with Java 11 and the consumer needed a component for use during runtime, compatible with Java 8
              - Other compatible attribute:
                  - Doesn't say anything about org.gradle.plugin.api-version (required '8.3')
